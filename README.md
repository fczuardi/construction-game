### "Solo" Open Source Game Dev

I don't consider myself a "solo-dev" because I am standing in the shoulders of giants, this work is only possible due to ethical people that share their knowledge, the Free Software movement and Free Culture as a whole.

There are **at least 61** other **amazing humans** that contributed with their time and their art to this game and I am incredibly thankful to every one of the people below:

## Open to work

I am also open to freelance work. I am, in fact, a contractor myself (although a knowledge worker, not a GC in the construction field).

I am more interested in gamedev at the moment, but throughout my career I have worked on different jobs in the computer industry, from advertisement agencies, to VC funded sillicon valley startups, to Open Source projects/communities, to Cloud providers, and I am open to many of the traditional roles in the computer industry.

I am a senior developer with experience in community-focused roles like dev-rel and technical writing, leading roles such as product management and squad leading, and of course, programmer / technical execution roles as well, like front-end development, QA etc.

I do special rates for Open Source projects, since they are my preference. If you need an energetic creative person that is able to cut scope and deliver well-documented no-bullshit products, or foster developer communities I might be the person for your team, lets talk on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabricio/).
