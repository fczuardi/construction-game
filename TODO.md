## Next steps

## Nice-to-have + ideas

- unmapped items
    - bitcoin coin


## Feedbacks:

- "run change the direction"
    - Isa didnt understood that run was a toggle and that there were 2 different camera angles

- camera should follow player
    - Marcelo, Tizen, Thiago, Zoide...

- 45deg snaps areunnecessary
    - Marcelo

- bitcoin coin is too close to the lock icon
    - Thiago thought that the lock was the Bitcoin coin (that was hard to get)

- small items are hard to get
    - Tizen made several turns to the same side when not able to catch an item
    - Zoide thinks if the camera points towards where you are heading it will make it easier to not miss the item
    
- map is difficult to read / motion sickness
    - Isa

- better objectives info / help / visual feedback
    - Zoide, Thiago

- swipe attempts
    - Zoide asked if there was a way to control camera

- nice graphics:
    - Zoide liked
- Zoide:
    - "quebrou faz mas grosso", lema de uma industria de tratores

- Zoide notou que a caminhada do demo 1 era mais folgadona
