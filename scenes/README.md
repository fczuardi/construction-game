# Construction Hero Scenes

This project is a reorganization of the components of the main game.

Each directory should contain one isolated element of the game, with a Test.tscene as a way to 
check on Godot the usage/instantiation of the isolated component/class/subscene.

The goal is to bring the progress of the chaotic main game project into bite-sized reusable atoms
that can be quickly tested and iterated on a more clean environment.

In other words: a lib of shareable/reusable components.
