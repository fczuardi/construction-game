Brainstorm /  reasoning

The protagonist of this game is a construction worker, a contractor, with regular human speed,
regular strengh (maybe a little stronger than average because of physical job), cannot jump 
high altitudes.

The game interface keeps track of the number of steps "spent" on each stage, as well as the
number of the collision in obstacles, passing a certain number of steps or collisions do
causes a game over condition.

The game's main audience is mobile gamers, so mechanics that assumes a controller pad
or a fullblown keyboard+mouse is out of the scope, this wont be a first person shooter or
a skill-needed action-packed adventure or souls-like, even though I would like to parody
/ pay homenage to the games of From Software whenever possible.

Movement input is expected to be limited, like touch to turn 45 degrees right or left, 
if we get inspiration from the game title: "Contractor Hero", the inputs can be intervalled 
single presses, like in a rythm game. Example: Parappa the Rapper, Guitar Hero, no key combinations
... "kick puch, it's all in the mind", left, right, right left...

The player has one action button that will for the most part be used to check a map in a clipboard,
the player will keep walking, like in an endless runner game, although with a smaller speed
when checking the map, because the camera will be toggled to a first person angle and the
clipboard will take most of the viewing frame. The player sees the floor moving and shadow of 
the scenario, like when passing below a crane arm, but could trip on a rock or bump into obstacles
because he was "looking down on the map".

Each stage will have some points of intersest or goal places that you need to reach with few steps
few turns and few mistakes, like for example a bathroom booth. At wich time, you can sit, and
enjoy the pause while reviewing your score.
