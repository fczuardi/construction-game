## Stages

The stages in the game follows the progression of the stages of a building construction,
from the set out to foundation, to walls raising to second floor to ceeiling, etc

Each stage has a set of items that you need to gather in order to progress to the next stage.

Once the minimal required items is gathered, the portal to the next level is unlocked and you can
have a pause, this portal is normally the toilet.


construction phases to model the game against:
site clearing, position the building (measured set backs), establish base points (wooden peg on 
base point, points a, b, c, 3, 4,5 triangle), establish all 4 corners, establish the profile boards,
mark escavation areas on the ground, excavate the foundation trenches, mark points for column pit 
excavation / column marks for escavation

profile boards = gabarito

## Old / Brainstorm /  reasoning

THIS DOCUMENT IS A DRAFT, MANY THINGS CAN CHANGE

The protagonist of this game is a construction worker, a contractor, with regular human speed,
regular strengh (maybe a little stronger than average because of physical job), cannot jump 
high altitudes.

The game's main audience is mobile gamers, so mechanics that assumes a controller pad
or a fullblown keyboard+mouse is out of the scope, this wont be a first person shooter or
a skill-needed action-packed adventure or souls-like, even though I would like to parody
/ pay homenage to the games of From Software whenever possible.

Movement input is expected to be limited, like touch to turn 45 degrees right or left, 
if we get inspiration from the game title: "Contractor Hero", the inputs can be intervalled 
single presses, like in a rythm game. Example: Parappa the Rapper, Guitar Hero, no key combinations
... "kick puch, it's all in the mind", left, right, right left...

The player has one action button that will for the most part be used to check a map in a clipboard,
the player will keep walking, like in an endless runner game, although with a smaller speed
when checking the map, because the camera will be toggled to a first person angle and the
clipboard will take most of the viewing frame. The player sees the floor moving and shadow of 
the scenario, like when passing below a crane arm, but could trip on a rock or bump into obstacles
because he was "looking down on the map".

Each stage will have some points of intersest or goal places that you need to reach with few steps
few turns and few mistakes, like for example a bathroom booth. At wich time, you can sit, and
enjoy the pause while reviewing your score.

But the stage of development of this game is still early and the gameplay mechanics are still open
to be found through experimentation as we go along.

I know that there should be a balance between a full copy of an existing game versus too much
innovation, having a genre as the basis to work on top of is probably good, and in the case of 
"contractor hero" my feeling is that the "base" genre is of Endless Runner.

In summary, the overall theme/ambientation is of a construction site, with tower cranes, cones,
fences, pipes, planks, steel bars, wheelbarrow, containers, cement bags, barriers, etc.

The protagonist will always be moving, so in my search for game mechanics, I am favouring something
that dont have pauses, the player choices will probably be related to tracing a path to get to
objectives, making turns and checking map information on a clipboard are elements that is safe
to assume that will be present.

The innovation part to put on top of the "endless runner" genre is the idea to have more directions
and more liberty over which path to follow, unlike the limited 3 lanes like subway surfer or hard 90
degree turns like Temple run.

Another inovation in mechanics might be the introduction of some rythm game elements on top of it,
the name of the game reminds us of Guitar Hero for example, but the "hero" part can also be something
else, like an everyday hero, a simple worker that saves the day for example, getting children
alway from danger for example (and a construction site might have lots of dangerous situations).
