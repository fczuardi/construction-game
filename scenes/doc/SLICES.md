# Vertical Playable Slices

Milestones for functionalities that will be part of the game, but can be demoed/tested in
isolation by gathering a smal subset of components:

## Locomotion with turns

Acceptance checklist:

    - [x] player walks, turns in 45Â° steps, and fall of edges (no jump)
    - steps and turns show in HUD
    - map button toggles first-person + slow speed
    - limts trigger a visible "game over"
    - reaching the goal triggers sit/score scene
