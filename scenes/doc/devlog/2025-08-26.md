# Demo-based library evolution

Since yesterday I am following new work guidelines, I wanted to keep my game components decoupled,
with single responsibilities if possible and maybe reusable for future games, and at the same time
I feel that obsessing on the perfect API for a component can be supper attractive and act as
procrastination/sabotage for the productivity and progress of the main game.

So... I dont want to abandon the idea of avoiding spagetthi code, I do want bite-sized scenes that
are useful to test it in isolation and that are easy to justify/reason about. But at the same time
I am the only customer of my library, so it dont make sense in design the interfaces too much, the
tool development should be driven by their purpose in helping the main game advance.

That's the basis for my new work guidelines, to think of "vertical slices", of features that are
used in the Contractor Hero game, those slices uses the lib components, that should have a minimal
surface area on their initial unstable versions.

Bellow is the result of my little detour, 4 simple components that will be used on a first "slice"
with the main character (the "runner") able to move, do 45 degree turns, fall, enter in a "map"
state where the camera goes into first person mode to look at a clipboard with a map, and in this
state the walk speed gets slower, this runner also broadcast statuses events, like distance walked,
turns queued, and obstacles hit:
