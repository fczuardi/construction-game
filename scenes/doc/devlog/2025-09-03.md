# Run, Run Run

Tuesday, coworking day, I have focused on rewrite/rethink the follow cameras, given the new
context that with the new controllers we now have a button to toggle run. So, in addition to
walk confidently and being able to check an empty "map" on the clipboard, the player will now
also be able to run and check on the map while running as well.

To be able to transit/blend between multiple cameras: shoulder view (walk), shoulder view (run),
first-person view (map while walk) and first-person view (map while running), lots of work had to
be done. The ending result is a configurable camera switcher that is flexxible enough to do the
transitions to cameras that can be external to the player visuals (the ones used for shoulder views)
and cameras that follow the player direction (yaw) because they are children of the visuals on godot
hierarchy.

One cool feature of having some cameras that are not attached to the player, is that we can have
camera angles of the player running south towards the camera, or from the side, like in the classic
Crash Bandicoot from PS1.

After showing it to my coworker [Lucas Fonseca][1] (play [Rocket Lander][2], follow him on Itch.io),
and talking about how the run camera should be a different angle of the shoulder camera, because
I really like the feeling of speed that a camera closer to the ground can create, he gave me
the great idea to introduce a little shake, a "wiggle" too on the running cameras, so now my
PlayerCameras component will auto add a wiggle if the camera name contains the word "Run" in it.


# Trail log

Wednesday was all about the map, I feel that looking at an empty paper on the clipboard character
prop is no longer acceptable, so I spent my day figuring out how to make the walk/run you do
on the game leave a trail of ink on the clipboard page. Lots of challenges and new learnings there,
figuring out textures based on viewports, their UV maps and how to make them proportional was a lot
more difficult than I could have forsee. ChatGPT's patience in explaining 3D stuff to me was invaluable.


And that's it, please [try out the running and the navigation trail][5] on the WIP slice (the bigger
play button) on the library project and please send feedback, looking the dots progress over
continuously in the blank page reminds me the toy [etch-a-scketch][3] that was named 
[Traço Mágico][4] in Brazil :)
