## Morning

### Quick Win 1: Pause Button

Started the day pursuing some quick wins to get my work engines on: a pause menu that will also
double as a Settings menu later on, grab an icon from [Remix Icon][1], a simple hamburguer should
do, [ri-menu-line][2], set layout anchors and sizing so it can adjust in the unknown viewport sizes
of many users, throw up a quick [pause toggle][3] on it. It's not really a menu yet, just a pause
button, which is already useful. Done.

### Quick Win 2: Pause Menu

On an endless runner I dont want the player to have the option to stop, but at the same time, some
minimal menu, even if only for having the Qui Game button, is a nice to have. The compromise here
will be having a big overlay that obscures most of the game area, a game with no pause option
is bad, but I dont want to give the player the option to pause the game to look at the map without
spending her steps, so more than 90% opacity on the blocker for now.

On a side note, yesterday I watched part of this youtube video about game design, with 100 games
that introduced or popularized some kind of innovation. I havent watched the whole video yet,
and there are some games in that compilation that I havent played, one of those games was Far Cry
(2, or 4, I cant remember) and the person listed it there exactly because of the "difficulties"
it introduced for gamers, like pistols jamming, having to take malaria medicine and not being
able to pause in a part where you have to follow a map on paper while driving a vehicle.

Maybe I should try this game, my idea of having a map that is on the hands of the character and
that do not have a compass was this same idea of "no breaks", "no stops". Anyways, I have built
a Pause Menu, that can be useful later to host settings, game modes or something like it, for now
it just presents a Quit Game button, with a proper "are you sure?" confirmation dialog, that in 
itself was another component I've made.

## Afternoon

Shared the morning work with ChatGpt for it to do a code-review, part of the afternoon was tweaking
the code to adopt some suggestions.

Fixed layout anchors on the index screen for the demos lib. Since yesterday I am using the setting
"Stretch > Mode > canvas_item" with "Stretch > Aspect > expand" to make the UI ready for different vieewport sizes. The Slice and the Index are already ready to support this, but I need to revisit all
the individual component demos to addapt them, although this isnt a priority because the demos
are more useful as smoke tests than anything else.

Fixed the HTML export and now the color palette switching in the PlayerControls demo work again.
